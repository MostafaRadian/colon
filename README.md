# CNN for Colorectal Cancer detection

Colorectal Cancer Classification using Deep Convolutional Networks

## Getting Started

This is an experiment trying to explore the work described in the paper Colorectal Cancer Classification using Deep Convolutional Networks [https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2018/66431/66431.pdf]. Note that it does not reproduce it literally and it doesn't not have any medical application purposes either.

### Prerequisites

The notebook was executed using TensorFlow 2.2

The dataset used here was downloaded from: https://github.com/tampapath/lung_colon_image_set

### Contents

colon.h5: a model trained with the proposed CNN in 10 epochs

colon.ipynb: the notebook

colon_image_sets: the dataset, with images split in 8000 for training and 2000 for validation.
